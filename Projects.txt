Project: Online Marketplace

Description:
Create an online marketplace where users can buy and sell goods. The website will allow users to create accounts, list items for sale, and make purchases using a payment gateway.

Features:

User authentication and authorization
Product listings with images, descriptions, and prices
Search functionality for finding products
Shopping cart and checkout process for purchasing products
Payment gateway integration
User profile pages to manage listings and purchase history
Admin panel to manage user accounts, listings, and transactions
MERN Stack Components:

MongoDB for storing product listings, user data, and transaction information
Express for building the backend API that handles user authentication, product listings, and transactions
React for building the frontend user interface, including product search and shopping cart functionality
Node.js for running the server-side code and integrating with the payment gateway
This project will give you a chance to practice using the MERN stack, including setting up a database, building a REST API, and creating a dynamic user interface. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to work with payment gateway integration, user authentication, and authorization, which are important features for any e-commerce website.
